What is this?
=

CleverStyle CMS is simple, scalable, and fast content management system.

Current version is Beta.

System core contains only basic functionality, so, it looks more like CMF (content management framework) rather than CMS.

But in parallel with core some components are developed:

#### Modules

 * **Blogs** (simple blogging functionality)
 * **Comments** (adds comments functionality to other modules)
 * **Content** (simple content functionality. May be used by other components or stand-alone)
 * **Cron** (provides GUI for crontab, scheduled tasks)
 * **Deferred tasks** (Deferred tasks allows other components to create tasks, that can be executed not immediately, but little bit later)
 * **Disqus** (Integration of Disqus commenting service, adds comments functionality to other modules)
 * **Feedback** (simple feedback module, sends message to admin's email)
 * **HybridAuth** (integration of [HybridAuth](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth) library for integration with social networks and other services)
 * **OAuth2** (provides realization of OAuth 2 authorization protocol (server side))
 * **Photo gallery** (simple photo gallery module, powered by Fotorama, Plupload and SimpleImage components)
 * **Plupload** (integration of [Plupload](https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload) for files uploading, adds files uploading functionality to other modules)
 * **Static pages** (allows to create static pages like About page or pages without interface, for example for site owner verification)

#### Plugins

 * **Admin default theme** (forces default CleverStyle theme in all administration pages, that is helpful, because there is no need to adapt custom theme for admin panel)
 * **Fotorama** (integration of [Fotorama](https://github.com/artpolikarpov/fotorama) jQuery gallery into CleverStyle CMS)
 * **SimpleImage** (integration of [SimpleImage](https://github.com/claviska/SimpleImage) class into CleverStyle CMS)
 * **TinyMCE** (integration of [TinyMCE](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce) WYSIWYG Editor for providing simpler content editing)

System is free, Open Source and is distributed under MIT license, see [license.txt](https://github.com/nazar-pc/CleverStyle-CMS/blob/master/license.txt)
