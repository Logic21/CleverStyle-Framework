What is this?

CleverStyle CMS is simple, scalable, and fast content management system.

Current version is Alpha.

System core contains only basic functionality, so, it looks more like CMF (content management framework) rather than CMS.

But in parallel with core some components are developed:

#### Modules

 * **Blogs** (simple blogging functionality)
 * **Comments** (adds comments functionality to other modules)
 * **Cron** (provides GUI for crontab, scheduled tasks)
 * **HybridAuth** (integration of [HybridAuth](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth) library for integration with social networks and other services)
 * **OAuth2** (provides realization of OAuth 2 authorization protocol (server side))
 * **Static pages** (allows to create static pages like About page or pages without interface, for example for site owner verification)

#### Plugins

 * **Admin default theme** (forces default CleverStyle theme in all administration pages, that is helpful, because there is no need to adapt custom theme for admin panel)
 * **TinyMCE** (integration of [TinyMCE](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce) WYSIWYG Editor for providing simpler content editing)

System is free, Open Source and is distributed under MIT license, see [license.txt](https://github.com/nazar-pc/CleverStyle-CMS/blob/master/license.txt)

Installation builds of core and components can be found on [downloads page](https://github.com/nazar-pc/CleverStyle-CMS/wiki/Download-installation-packages).
