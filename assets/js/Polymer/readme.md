Polymer build included is a JavaScript source code obtained as the result of running `estimate-size` command (file `dist/bundled/polymer.html`) as well as files `dist/bundled/bower_components/shadycss/apply-shim.min.js` and `dist/bundled/bower_components/shadycss/custom-style-interface.min.js`

Hacks:
* apply-shim is hacked according to https://github.com/webcomponents/shadycss/issues/91#issuecomment-312478101 (not necessarily correct, but at least fonts work fine)
