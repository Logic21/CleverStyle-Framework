### WARNING: Plugins are deprecated, use modules instead

Plugins are used for so-called "hidden work". They are executed on every page, but may have no visual representation.

For example, plugin can provide web site statistic, or add WYSIWYG HTML editor to text areas on pages.

In internal structure it is simplified version of module, that doesn't have database settings and plugin configuration.

All plugins are located in directory **components/plugins**. Sometimes plugins may be used as addition to module, and connected by dependence.
